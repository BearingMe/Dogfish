# Research Memory Index

## Project Identity & Target Version

## Documentation Landscape & Architectural Shift
- **Status**: CONFIRMED
- **Finding**: Documentation is decentralized across Nexus #65628, Reddit, Patreon, and Discord. In v0.3.x, the author moved operational management away from early MCM menus into native Papyrus dialogue trees with recruited officers (Steward for civil/diplomatic, Commander for military). Upgrading across major versions (0.1 -> 0.2 -> 0.3) strictly broke save game compatibility.

## Comprehensive Feature Architecture
- **Status**: CONFIRMED
- **Finding**: *Conquest of Skyrim* v0.3.9 encompasses 51 individually tracked features across 18 strategic domains (`FEAT-FACT` through `FEAT-UI`). The core gameplay loop links Faction Creation -> Territory -> Outposts/Resources -> Military Recruitment/Armies -> War Declaration -> City Sieges -> Hold Jarl Appointments -> The Moot Coronation.

## Critical Stability Failure Modes & Incompatibilities
- **Status**: CONFIRMED
- **Finding**: *Conquest of Skyrim* has severe conflicts with vanilla Civil War quests (`CW01`/`CW02`/`Season Unending`), *Open Civil War*, and external follower frameworks (NFF/AFT). Major v0.3.9 defects include an internal hold-count mismatch blocking The Moot (`ISSUE-QST-01`), proximity trigger failures at Fort Amol (`ISSUE-QST-02`), and naked troop outfit evaluation delays (`ISSUE-GAME-01`).
